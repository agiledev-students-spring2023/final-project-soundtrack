# Project Description
Every generation has its own unique connection to the arts. Now more than ever, people define their identities by preferences that form a curated aesthetic. These preferences include those of fashion, cuisine, and (arguably most importantly) music. Vast online communities have been formed through the sharing of tastes, and the association between these tastes and certain lifestyles.

SoundTrack is a web application that tracks users’ listening history across different locations. The app brings users together based on common places that they frequent, and the music they associate with these places by creating playlists of songs posted at these locations.

Next time you’re in a cozy cafe, a dark-academia library, or your favorite museum, make yourself the main character and pull up a perfectly tailored playlist curated by like-minded peers. Live life to your own soundTrack.
